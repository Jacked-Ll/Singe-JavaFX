# Singe-JavaFX
This is a project that uses Maven as dependency management and JavaFX for the GUIof an application that tests your ability to use a computer.
My starting goal for this project was to upgrade an earlier project I made using swing that tracked your mouse movements over a session you use your computer.
It would then display them to you using colours to show the speeds of movement.
I would like to recreate this
